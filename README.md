2. Clebsch surface with 27 lines (full surface / surface with embossed lines / just lines)
3. Nested rulings
4. Triangular cylinder subdivsion with magnets
5. Triangular cylinder barycentric subdivision with magnets
6. Cube skeleton with twisted cubic curve inside, and with projections in three faces (same w/ other parametric curves).
