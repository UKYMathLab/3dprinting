# 3D Printing

## TODO
1. Triangular cylinder subdivsion with magnets 
2. Triangular cylinder barycentric subdivision with magnets
3. Rulings
4. Nested rulings
5. Cube skeleton with twisted cubic curve inside, and with projections in three faces (same w/ other parametric curves)
6. Fermat cubic
7. Clebsh surface with UKY Math Lab inscription, labels for lines, etc.



## Finished
1. Saddle (Calculus III)
2. Paraboloid with track (Calculus III)
3. Normal vector and tangent plane (Calculus III)
4. Integration with spherical coordinates (Calculus III)
5. Clebsh surface with 27 lines


## Miscellaneous Notes
1. Need file hosting service for large files like .stl and .blend files (Google Drive is sufficient)
2. TODO list does not necessarily indicate completion order, only priority, usually determined by "first come, first served" and level of difficulty
